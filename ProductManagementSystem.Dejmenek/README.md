  - Add new staff members
  - Update staff information
  - Delete staff accounts
  - View all staff members

## Used Technologies

- **Frontend**: 
  - Razor Pages
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Bootstrap

- **Backend**:
  - .NET 9.0
  - ASP.NET Core Identity (Authentication & Authorization)
  - Entity Framework Core (ORM)

- **Database**:
  - SQL Server

- **Logging**:
  - Serilog (with SQL Server sink)

- **Additional Libraries**:
  - FluentValidation (Input validation)

## Database Structure

The application uses a hierarchical product model with Table-Per-Hierarchy (TPH) inheritance strategy:

- **Products Table**: Base table storing all products with a discriminator column
  - Product (base)
  - Computer (abstract, extends Product)
    - Laptop (extends Computer)
    - Desktop (extends Computer)

- **Logs Table**: Table storing data related to application's activity
- **Identity Tables**: ASP.NET Core Identity tables for user management and authentication

## Local Setup

This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the ProductManagementSystem on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** or later - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- **SQL Server** or **SQL Server LocalDB** (included with Visual Studio)
  - For LocalDB, you can install it via Visual Studio Installer or as a standalone component
- **A code editor** such as Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dejmenek/ProductManagementSystem.git
   cd ProductManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Database Configuration

The application uses SQL Server LocalDB by default. The connection string is configured in `src/ProductManagementSystem.Web/appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=PMS;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=True"
}
```

**Database Initialization:**

The database and tables will be created automatically when you first run the application thanks to Entity Framework Core migrations.

If you need to use a different SQL Server instance, update the `DefaultConnection` string in `appsettings.json` accordingly.

### Email Configuration

The application requires email configuration for user registration, email confirmation, and password recovery features. Email settings are configured in `src/ProductManagementSystem.Web/appsettings.json` under the `EmailConfig` section.

#### Default Configuration

```json
"EmailConfig": {
  "From": "",
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "Port": 465,
  "Username": "",
  "Password": ""
}
```

#### Setting Up Email for Local Development

To enable email functionality, you need to configure the following fields:

1. **From**: The email address that will appear as the sender
   - Example: `"noreply@yourdomain.com"` or your Gmail address

2. **SmtpServer**: The SMTP server address
   - For Gmail: `"smtp.gmail.com"` (default)
   - For Outlook/Hotmail: `"smtp-mail.outlook.com"`
   - For other providers, check their SMTP server documentation

3. **Port**: The SMTP port number
   - For Gmail with SSL: `465` (default)
   - For Gmail with TLS: `587`
   - For Outlook: `587`

4. **Username**: Your email account username
   - For Gmail: Your full Gmail address (e.g., `"yourname@gmail.com"`)
   - For Outlook: Your full Outlook/Hotmail address

5. **Password**: Your email account password or app-specific password
   - **Important**: For Gmail, you must use an **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
   - For Outlook, you may also need an app-specific password if you have 2FA enabled

#### Example Configuration for Gmail

```json
"EmailConfig": {
  "From": "yourname@gmail.com",
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "Port": 465,
  "Username": "yourname@gmail.com",
  "Password": "your-app-specific-password"
}
```

### Running the Application

1. **Navigate to the Web project directory**
   ```bash
   cd src/ProductManagementSystem.Web
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the console (typically `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`)
   - The database will be created automatically on first run
   - You can now register a staff account (requires email confirmation)

## Usage Examples

### Product Management Interface
The main product management interface allows users to view, add, edit, and delete products with comprehensive filtering and sorting options.

## Learned Things & Study Materials

### Caching
Implemented server-side caching using `MemoryCache`. Learned about various cache types and strategies such as cache-aside, write-through, and read-through. Explored cache eviction policies and common problems like cache stampede, hot keys and cache consistency for system design.

### Authorization
Practiced implementing authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity.

### Clean Architecture
Practiced the principles and structure of clean architecture in this project.

### Study Materials
- [Caching in a system design interview](https://youtu.be/1NngTUYPdpI?si=Epb7zjwx3KRlxWlz)
- [Caching system design concept for beginners](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/caching-system-design-concept-for-beginners)

## Notes

- Clean architecture was implemented in this project for practice purposes only. It is clearly an overkill for a simple project like this, but served as a valuable learning experience.
